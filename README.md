# spin_the_wheel challenge

![wheel.png](https://github.com/HIVERY/spin_the_wheel/blob/master/wheel.png)

Objective: implement a browser interface that
- allows the user to spin a wheel
- displays the results of the last 5 spins

Main points:
- the wheel contains the numbers 1 to 10, in any order
- to spin the wheel, the user can drag the mouse, or use a touchscreen gesture
- after each spin, the wheel should slow down and stop, with the marker pointing at a single number
 
When you finish, please send us the link to your github repo, so we can evaluate it.

We need to be able to run your code (on a Mac or Linux machine) by following these steps:
``` 
1) git clone <your project>
2) cd <your project>
3) run command to install dependencies
4) run command to execute the application
5) access the interface via the Chrome browser
```
You can assume we have already installed Python and Node.

Bonus points:
- it works in a recent version of IE
- 80% test coverage
- implemented using ES6 (with a compiler of your choice)

Good luck!
