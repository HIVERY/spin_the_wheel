# Spin the Wheel - version 1.1

![wheel.png](https://github.com/HIVERY/spin_the_wheel/blob/master/wheel.png)

Objective: implement a browser interface that
- allows the user to spin a wheel
- predicts the next result
- tracks prediction accuracy over time

## _Main points_
- the wheel contains the numbers 1 to 10, in any order
- to spin the wheel, the user can drag the mouse, or use a touchscreen gesture
- after each spin, the wheel slows down and stops, with the marker pointing at a single number

## _Unit tests_
- please include unit tests
- you should have at least 50% test coverage
 
## _Important_
- copy the version number (of this challenge) into your README file

When you finish, send us the link to your github repo, so we can evaluate it. We need to be able to run your code (on a Mac or Linux machine) by following these steps:
``` 
1) git clone <your project>
2) cd <your project>
3) run command to install dependencies
4) run command to execute the application
5) access the interface via the Chrome browser
```
You can assume we have already installed Python and Node.

## _Bonus points_
- implemented using ES6 (with a compiler of your choice)
- it works in a recent version of IE
- prediction accuracy > 10%
- 85% test coverage

Good luck!
